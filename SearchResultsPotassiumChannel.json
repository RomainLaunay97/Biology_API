They are important in shaping the action potential, and in neuronal excitability and plasticity [[cite:PUB00004020]]. The potassium channel family is composed of several functionally distinct isoforms, which can be broadly separated into 2 groups [[cite:PUB00006577]]: the practically non-inactivating 'delayed' group and the rapidly inactivating 'transient' group.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These are all highly similar proteins, with only small amino acid changes causing the diversity of the voltage-dependent gating mechanism, channel conductance and toxin binding properties. Each type of K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel is activated by different signals and conditions depending on their type of regulation: some open in response to depolarisation of the plasma membrane; others in response to hyperpolarisation or an increase in intracellular calcium concentration; some can be regulated by binding of a transmitter, together with intracellular kinases; while others are regulated by GTP-binding proteins or other second messengers [[cite:PUB00004011]]. In eukaryotic cells, K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels are involved in neural signalling and generation of the cardiac rhythm, act as effectors in signal transduction pathways involving G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and may have a role in target cell lysis by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00002771]]. In prokaryotic cells, they play a role in the maintenance of ionic homeostasis [[cite:PUB00009378]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;All K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels discovered so far possess a core of alpha subunits, each comprising either one or two copies of a highly conserved pore loop domain (P-domain). The P-domain contains the sequence (T/SxxTxGxG), which has been termed the K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;selectivity sequence. In families that contain one P-domain, four subunits assemble to form a selective pathway for K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;across the membrane. However, it remains unclear how the 2 P-domain subunits assemble to form a selective pore. The functional diversity of these families can arise through homo-or hetero-associations of alpha subunits or association with auxiliary cytoplasmic beta subunits. K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel subunits containing one pore domain can be assigned into one of two superfamilies: those that possess six transmembrane (TM) domains and those that possess only two TM domains. The six TM domain superfamily can be further subdivided into conserved gene families: the voltage-gated (Kv) channels; the KCNQ channels (originally known as KvLQT channels); the EAG-like K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels; and three types of calcium (Ca)-activated K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels (BK, IK and SK) [[cite:PUB00009378]]. The 2TM domain family comprises inward-rectifying K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels. In addition, there are K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel alpha-subunits that possess two P-domains.

Disruption of the Eag gene caused an ether-induced, leg-shaking behaviour. Subsequent studies have revealed a conserved multi-gene family of EAG-like K+ channels, which are present in human and many other species. Based on the varying functional properties of the channels, the family has been divided into 3 subfamilies: EAG, ELK and ERG. Interestingly, Caenorhabditis elegans appears to lack the ELK type [[cite:PUB00007312]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG), cloned from hippocampus, shares 49% amino acid identity with EAG. It is also found in the heart, where it helps to control K+ efflux [[cite:PUB00008904]].

Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are responsible for regulating diverse processes including: cellular excitability, vascular tone, heart rate, renal salt flow, and insulin release [[cite:PUB00009410]]. To date, around twenty members of this superfamily have been cloned, which can be grouped into six families by sequence similarity, and these are designated Kir1.x-6.x [[cite:PUB00001069], [cite:PUB00009411]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cloned Kir channel cDNAs encode proteins of between ~370-500 residues, both N-and C-termini are thought to be cytoplasmic, and the N terminus lacks a signal sequence. Kir channel alpha subunits possess only 2TM domains linked with a P-domain. Thus, Kir channels share similarity with the fifth and sixth domains, and P-domain of the other families. It is thought that four Kir subunits assemble to form a tetrameric channel complex, which may be hetero-or homomeric [[cite:PUB00009410]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This metazoan domain is found to the N terminus of Inward rectifier potassium channels (KIR2 or IRK2).&lt;/p&gt;"],"name":["Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying, Kir, N-terminal"],"source_database":["INTERPRO"]}},{"id":"IPR024587","source":"interpro7_domain","fields":{"description":["&lt;p&gt;Potassium channels are the most diverse group of the ion channel family [[cite:PUB00001055], [cite:PUB00001622]].

Each alpha subunit comprises six hydrophobic TM domains with a P-domain between the fifth and sixth, which partially resides in the membrane. The fourth TM domain has positively charged residues at every third residue and acts as a voltage sensor, which triggers the conformational change that opens the channel pore in response to a displacement in membrane potential [[cite:PUB00009391]]. More recently, 4 new electrically-silent alpha subunits have been cloned: Kv5 (KCNF), Kv6 (KCNG), Kv8 and Kv9 (KCNS).

The fourth TM domain has positively charged residues at every third residue and acts as a voltage sensor, which triggers the conformational change that opens the channel pore in response to a displacement in membrane potential [[cite:PUB00009391]]. More recently, 4 new electrically-silent alpha subunits have been cloned: Kv5 (KCNF), Kv6 (KCNG), Kv8 and Kv9 (KCNS). These subunits do not themselves possess any functional activity, but appear to form heteromeric channels with Kv2 subunits, and thus modulate Shab channel activity [[cite:PUB00008322]]. When highly expressed, they inhibit channel activity, but at lower levels show more specific modulatory actions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first Kv1 sequence (also known as Shaker) was found in Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly). Several vertebrate potassium channels with similar amino acid sequences were subsequently found and, together with the D. melanogaster Shaker channel, now constitute the Kv1 family. The family consists of at least 6 genes (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5 and Kv1.6) which each play distinct physiological roles. A conserved motif found towards the C terminus of these channels is required for efficient processing and surface expression [[cite:PUB00036044]]. Variations in this motif account for the differences in cell surface expression and localisation between family members. These channels are mostly expressed in the brain, but can also be found in non-excitable cells, such as lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00007312]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry features the tandem inactivation domain found at the N terminus of the Kv1.4 potassium channel. It is composed of two subdomains. Inactivation domain 1 (ID1, residues 1-38) consists of a flexible N terminus anchored at a 5-turn helix, and is thought to work by occluding the ion pathway, as is the case with a classical ball domain. Inactivation domain 2 (ID2, residues 40-50) is a 2.5 turn helix with a high proportion of hydrophobic residues that probably serves to attach ID1 to the cytoplasmic face of the channel. In this way, it can promote rapid access of ID1 to the receptor site in the open channel. ID1 and ID2 function together to bring about fast inactivation of the Kv1.4 channel, which is important for the role of the channel in short-term plasticity [[cite:PUB00016528]].&lt;/p&gt;"],"name":["Potassium channel, voltage dependent, Kv1.4, tandem inactivation domain"],"source_database":["INTERPRO"]}},{"id":"IPR028325","source":"interpro7_family","fields":{"description":["&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the the voltage-gated Kv channel and the KCNQ channel.

These channels are thought to play a role in shortening of action potential durations and modulating pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release. In mammals, the family consists of 4 genes (Kv3.1, Kv3.2, Kv3.3 and Kv3.4). Each gene product has its own subcellular location and function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Kv family can be divided into several subfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity and function. Four of these subfamilies, Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw) and Kv4 (Shal), consist of pore-forming alpha subunits that associate with different types of beta subunit. Each alpha subunit comprises six hydrophobic TM domains with a P-domain between the fifth and sixth, which partially resides in the membrane. The fourth TM domain has positively charged residues at every third residue and acts as a voltage sensor, which triggers the conformational change that opens the channel pore in response to a displacement in membrane potential [[cite:PUB00009391]]. More recently, 4 new electrically-silent alpha subunits have been cloned: Kv5 (KCNF), Kv6 (KCNG), Kv8 and Kv9 (KCNS).

Four of these subfamilies, Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw) and Kv4 (Shal), consist of pore-forming alpha subunits that associate with different types of beta subunit. Each alpha subunit comprises six hydrophobic TM domains with a P-domain between the fifth and sixth, which partially resides in the membrane.

Four of these subfamilies, Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw) and Kv4 (Shal), consist of pore-forming alpha subunits that associate with different types of beta subunit. Each alpha subunit comprises six hydrophobic TM domains with a P-domain between the fifth and sixth, which partially resides in the membrane. The fourth TM domain has positively charged residues at every third residue and acts as a voltage sensor, which triggers the conformational change that opens the channel pore in response to a displacement in membrane potential [[cite:PUB00009391]]. More recently, 4 new electrically-silent alpha subunits have been cloned: Kv5 (KCNF), Kv6 (KCNG), Kv8 and Kv9 (KCNS). These subunits do not themselves possess any functional activity, but appear to form heteromeric channels with Kv2 subunits, and thus modulate Shab channel activity [[cite:PUB00008322]]. When highly expressed, they inhibit channel activity, but at lower levels show more specific modulatory actions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first Kv1 sequence (also known as Shaker) was found in Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly). Several vertebrate potassium channels with similar amino acid sequences were subsequently found and, together with the D. melanogaster Shaker channel, now constitute the Kv1 family. The family consists of at least 6 genes (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5 and Kv1.6) which each play distinct physiological roles. A conserved motif found towards the C terminus of these channels is required for efficient processing and surface expression [[cite:PUB00036044]]. Variations in this motif account for the differences in cell surface expression and localisation between family members. These channels are mostly expressed in the brain, but can also be found in non-excitable cells, such as lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00007312]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kv1.2 channels are uniformly distributed in the heart and brain. They play diverse functional roles in several neuronal compartments, especially in the regulation of pre- and post-synaptic membrane excitability. Kv1.2 subunits can co-localise with other Kv1 subunits. For example, Kv1.2 colocalises with Kv1.1 in the nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons, and in the brain, in particular, the axons and nerve terminals; Kv1.2 coassembles with Kv1.4 subunits. In addition, Kv1.2 assembles with the Kv-beta2 subunit resulting in the promotion of Kv1.2 transport to the cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;"],"name":["Potassium channel, voltage dependent, Kv1.2"],"source_database":["INTERPRO"]}},{"id":"IPR004050","source":"interpro7_family","fields":{"description":["&lt;p&gt;Potassium channels are the most diverse group of the ion channel family [[cite:PUB00001055], [cite:PUB00001622]].

CASK and Lin-2 are membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK)-like proteins. CASK (also known as Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, CAKI, and Camguk) has a role in synaptic transmembrane protein anchoring and ion channel trafficking. CASK may regulate transmembrane proteins that bind calcium, calmodulin, or nucleotides; it regulates the Drosophila ether a go-go (eag) potassium channel, and also regulates autophosphorylation of CaMKII. CASK binding partners include the transcription factor TBR1, and cell-surface proteins, including amyloid precursor protein, neurexins, and syndecans. Lin-2, as a component of the CLin-10-Lin-2-Lin-7 complex, plays a role in controlling the basolateral localization of the EGF receptor Let-23; this complex also associates with the neuron-specific motor protein KIF17 to transport vesicles containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B along microtubules. CASK may also function in targeting or scaffolding of the protein parkin which is selectively truncated by a Parkinson's disease-causing mutation; the C-terminus of parkin functions as a class II PDZ-binding motif that binds CASK.

The P-domain contains the sequence (T/SxxTxGxG), which has been termed the K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;selectivity sequence. In families that contain one P-domain, four subunits assemble to form a selective pathway for K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;across the membrane. However, it remains unclear how the 2 P-domain subunits assemble to form a selective pore. The functional diversity of these families can arise through homo-or hetero-associations of alpha subunits or association with auxiliary cytoplasmic beta subunits. K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel subunits containing one pore domain can be assigned into one of two superfamilies: those that possess six transmembrane (TM) domains and those that possess only two TM domains. The six TM domain superfamily can be further subdivided into conserved gene families: the voltage-gated (Kv) channels; the KCNQ channels (originally known as KvLQT channels); the EAG-like K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels; and three types of calcium (Ca)-activated K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels (BK, IK and SK) [[cite:PUB00009378]]. The 2TM domain family comprises inward-rectifying K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels. In addition, there are K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel alpha-subunits that possess two P-domains. These are usually highly regulated K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;selective leak channels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2P-domain channels influence the resting membrane potential and as a result can control cell excitability. In addition, they pass K+ in response to changes in membrane potential, and are also tightly regulated by molecular oxygen, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), noradrenaline and serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first member of this family (TOK1), cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00004219]], is predicted to have eight potential transmembrane (TM) helices. However, subsequently-cloned two P-domain family members from Drosophila and mammalian species are predicted to have only four TM segments. They are usually referred to as TWIK-related channels (Tandem of P-domains in a Weakly Inward rectifying K+ channel) [[cite:PUB00004878], [cite:PUB00001298], [cite:PUB00001278], [cite:PUB00001308]]. Functional characterisation of these channels has revealed a diversity of properties in that they may show inward or outward rectification, their activity may be modulated in different directions by protein phosphorylation, and their sensitivity to changes in intracellular or extracellular pH varies. Despite these disparate properties, they are all thought to share the same topology of four TM segments, including two P-domains. That TWIK-related K+ channels all produce instantaneous and non-inactivating K+ currents, which do not display a voltage-dependent activation threshold, suggests that they are background (leak) K+ channels involved in the generation and modulation of the resting membrane potential in various cell types. Further studies have revealed that they may be found in many species, including: plants, invertebrates and mammals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TWIK family members (TWIK-1 and TWIK-2) produce constitutive K+ currents of weak amplitude [[cite:PUB00007784]]. They are present in a variety of tissues, including brain and cells of the immune system. Together with their functional properties, their wide distribution suggests that these channels may be involved in the control of background K+ conductances in many cell types.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TWIK-2 is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as the brain and immune system. The transient and delayed activities of TWIK-2 suggests that it may play an important role in cell electrogenesis [[cite:PUB00007784], [cite:PUB00018829]]. Pharmacologically, TWIK-2 channels are distinct from TWIK-1 channels in terms of their response to quinidine and barium.

In eukaryotic cells, K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels are involved in neural signalling and generation of the cardiac rhythm, act as effectors in signal transduction pathways involving G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and may have a role in target cell lysis by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00002771]]. In prokaryotic cells, they play a role in the maintenance of ionic homeostasis [[cite:PUB00009378]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;All K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels discovered so far possess a core of alpha subunits, each comprising either one or two copies of a highly conserved pore loop domain (P-domain). The P-domain contains the sequence (T/SxxTxGxG), which has been termed the K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;selectivity sequence. In families that contain one P-domain, four subunits assemble to form a selective pathway for K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;across the membrane. However, it remains unclear how the 2 P-domain subunits assemble to form a selective pore. The functional diversity of these families can arise through homo-or hetero-associations of alpha subunits or association with auxiliary cytoplasmic beta subunits. K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel subunits containing one pore domain can be assigned into one of two superfamilies: those that possess six transmembrane (TM) domains and those that possess only two TM domains. The six TM domain superfamily can be further subdivided into conserved gene families: the voltage-gated (Kv) channels; the KCNQ channels (originally known as KvLQT channels); the EAG-like K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels; and three types of calcium (Ca)-activated K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels (BK, IK and SK) [[cite:PUB00009378]]. The 2TM domain family comprises inward-rectifying K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels. In addition, there are K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel alpha-subunits that possess two P-domains. These are usually highly regulated K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;selective leak channels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two types of beta subunit (KCNE and KCNAB) are presently known to associate with voltage-gated alpha subunits (Kv, KCNQ and eag-like). However, not all combinations of alpha and beta subunits are possible. The KCNE family of K+ channel subunits are membrane glycoproteins that possess a single transmembrane (TM) domain. They share no structural relationship with the alpha subunit proteins, which possess pore forming domains. The subunits appear to have a regulatory function, modulating the kinetics and voltage dependence of the alpha subunits of voltage-dependent K+ channels. KCNE subunits are formed from short polypeptides of ~130 amino acids, and are divided into five subfamilies: KCNE1 (MinK/IsK), KCNE2 (MiRP1), KCNE3 (MiRP2), KCNE4 (MiRP3) and KCNE1L (AMMECR2).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KCNE2 subunits associate with the eag-like HERG alpha subunits, which are the pore-forming subunits of cardiac IKr channels. Channels formed solely from HERG subunits display similar properties to native IKr channels; however, they differ in their gating and single channel conductance. Channels formed from both KCNE2 and HERG exhibit properties that are identical to those seen in native IKr channels. Three mutations in the KCNE2 gene are associated with long QT syndrome and ventricular fibrillation. These mutations result in channels that open slower and close more rapidly, the net effect being a reduced K+ current [[cite:PUB00007814]].&lt;/p&gt;"],"name":["Potassium channel, voltage-dependent, beta subunit, KCNE2"],"source_database":["INTERPRO"]}},{"id":"cd18363","source":"interpro7_domain","fields":{"description":["&lt;p&gt;The group of KCTD proteins includes KCTD3 and SHKBP1.

They are important in shaping the action potential, and in neuronal excitability and plasticity [[cite:PUB00004020]]. The potassium channel family is composed of several functionally distinct isoforms, which can be broadly separated into 2 groups [[cite:PUB00006577]]: the practically non-inactivating 'delayed' group and the rapidly inactivating 'transient' group.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These are all highly similar proteins, with only small amino acid changes causing the diversity of the voltage-dependent gating mechanism, channel conductance and toxin binding properties. Each type of K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel is activated by different signals and conditions depending on their type of regulation: some open in response to depolarisation of the plasma membrane; others in response to hyperpolarisation or an increase in intracellular calcium concentration; some can be regulated by binding of a transmitter, together with intracellular kinases; while others are regulated by GTP-binding proteins or other second messengers [[cite:PUB00004011]]. In eukaryotic cells, K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels are involved in neural signalling and generation of the cardiac rhythm, act as effectors in signal transduction pathways involving G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and may have a role in target cell lysis by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00002771]].

The P-domain contains the sequence (T/SxxTxGxG), which has been termed the K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;selectivity sequence. In families that contain one P-domain, four subunits assemble to form a selective pathway for K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;across the membrane. However, it remains unclear how the 2 P-domain subunits assemble to form a selective pore. The functional diversity of these families can arise through homo-or hetero-associations of alpha subunits or association with auxiliary cytoplasmic beta subunits. K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel subunits containing one pore domain can be assigned into one of two superfamilies: those that possess six transmembrane (TM) domains and those that possess only two TM domains. The six TM domain superfamily can be further subdivided into conserved gene families: the voltage-gated (Kv) channels; the KCNQ channels (originally known as KvLQT channels); the EAG-like K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels; and three types of calcium (Ca)-activated K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels (BK, IK and SK) [[cite:PUB00009378]]. The 2TM domain family comprises inward-rectifying K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channels. In addition, there are K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;channel alpha-subunits that possess two P-domains. These are usually highly regulated K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;selective leak channels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are the principal class of two-TM domain potassium channels. They are characterised by the property of inward-rectification, which is described as the ability to allow large inward currents and smaller outward currents. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are responsible for regulating diverse processes including: cellular excitability, vascular tone, heart rate, renal salt flow, and insulin release [[cite:PUB00009410]]. To date, around twenty members of this superfamily have been cloned, which can be grouped into six families by sequence similarity, and these are designated Kir1.x-6.x [[cite:PUB00001069], [cite:PUB00009411]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cloned Kir channel cDNAs encode proteins of between ~370-500 residues, both N-and C-termini are thought to be cytoplasmic, and the N terminus lacks a signal sequence. Kir channel alpha subunits possess only 2TM domains linked with a P-domain. Thus, Kir channels share similarity with the fifth and sixth domains, and P-domain of the other families. It is thought that four Kir subunits assemble to form a tetrameric channel complex, which may be hetero-or homomeric [[cite:PUB00009410]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kir1.1 channels (also known as ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 1, Kcnj1 and ROMK1-6) are thought to underlie\n               K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;secretion in the kidney.

In hyperosmotic or hypotonic low-chloride stress conditions, WNK1 is activated and it phosphorylates its substrates including SPAK and OSR1 kinases, which regulate the activity of cation-chloride cotransporters through direct interaction and phosphorylation. Mutations in WNK1 cause PseudoHypoAldosteronism type II (PHAII), characterized by hypertension and hyperkalemia. WNK1 negates WNK4-mediated inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter NCC and activates the epithelial sodium channel ENaC by activating SGK1. WNK1 also decreases the surface expression of renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) by stimulating their endocytosis. Hypertension and hyperkalemia in PHAII patients with WNK1 mutations may be due partly to increased activity of NCC and ENaC, and impaired renal potassium secretion by ROMK, respectively. In addition, WNK1 interacts with MEKK2/3 and acts as an activator of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 5. It also negatively regulates TGFbeta signaling. WNKs comprise a subfamily of STKs with an unusual placement of the catalytic lysine relative to all other protein kinases.

G proteins and their receptors (GPCRs) form one of the most prevalent signalling systems in mammalian cells, regulating systems as diverse as sensory perception, cell growth and hormonal regulation [[cite:PUB00015166]]. At the cell surface, the binding of ligands such as hormones and neurotransmitters to a GPCR activates the receptor by causing a conformational change, which in turn activates the bound G protein on the intracellular-side of the membrane. The activated receptor promotes the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on the G protein alpha subunit. GTP binding changes the conformation of switch regions within the alpha subunit, which allows the bound trimeric G protein (inactive) to be released from the receptor, and to dissociate into active alpha subunit (GTP-bound) and beta/gamma dimer. The alpha subunit and the beta/gamma dimer go on to activate distinct downstream effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase, phosphodiesterases, phospholipase C, and ion channels. These effectors in turn regulate the intracellular concentrations of secondary messengers, such as cAMP, diacylglycerol, sodium or calcium cations, which ultimately lead to a physiological response, usually via the downstream regulation of gene transcription. The cycle is completed by the hydrolysis of alpha subunit-bound GTP to GDP, resulting in the re-association of the alpha and beta/gamma subunits and their binding to the receptor, which terminates the signal [[cite:PUB00015168]].

The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6, another binding partner of URB2, and an additional factor Mub1, are required for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Rpn4. UBR2 associates with Mub1 to form a Mub1/Ubr2 complex that regulates the conserved Dsn1 kinetochore protein levels, which is a part of a quality control system that monitors kinetochore integrity, thus ensuring genomic stability. As the recognition component of a major cellular proteolytic system, UBR2 is associated with chromatin and controls chromatin dynamics and gene expression in both spermatocytes and somatic cells. UBR2 also mediates transcriptional silencing during spermatogenesis via histone ubiquitination. It functions as a scaffold E3 promoting HR6B/UbcH2-dependent ubiquitylation of H2A and H2B, but not H3 and H4. It also binds to Tex19.1, also known as Tex19, a germ cell-specific protein, and metabolically stabilizes it during spermatogenesis. Furthermore, UBR2 is involved in skeletal muscle (SKM) atrophy. Its expression can be modulated by the mouse ether-a-gogo-related gene 1a (MERG1a) potassium channel.

These regions can be found on the same\nprotein (mostly in eukaryotes and bacterial exporters) or on two different\nones (mostly bacterial importers) [[cite:PUB00014769]]. The function of the integral\ninner-membrane protein is to translocate the substrate across the membrane.\nStudies of P-glycoprotein function indicate that residues lining the proposed\nchamber opening (residues of TM2, TM5 and TM6) play an important role in\nsubstrate recognition [[cite:PUB00018398]].\n\nIn exporters and eukaryotes, ABC transporters consist of a single polypeptide\ncomposed of an N-terminal domain of approximately 320 residues, apparently\ncontaining six transmembrane segments, fused to a highly conserved ABC-ATPase\ndomain of approximately 260 residues [[cite:PUB00004998]][[cite:PUB00003841]][[cite:PUB00018399]].

The chamber has an opening on either side\nof the membrane to provide free access for the lipid substrate from the\ncytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer, while excluding molecules from the\nouter leaflet. The chamber openings are defined by intramolecular interactions\nbetween TM2 of one monomer and TM5 of the other. The residues lining the\nchamber are contributed by all 12 transmembrane alpha-helices [10,11].\n\nIn importers (found only in prokaryotes or archaea) most ABC transporters\nconsist of four domains usually encoded by independent polypeptides, two ABC\nmodules and two TMDs which are thought to contain six transmembrane regions\n[12,13]. The approximately 30 kD TMD displays a distinctive signature, the EAA\nmotif, a 20 amino acid conserved sequence located about 100 residues from the\nC-terminus. The motif is hydrophilic and has been found to reside in a\ncytoplasmic loop located between the penultimate and the antepenultimate\ntransmembrane segment in all proteins with a known topology [14,15,16]. It\nappears to play an important role in ensuring the correct assembly of the\nprokaryotic ABC transport complex [17] and constituting an interaction site\nwith the so-called helical domain of the ABC module [18,19]. The TMDs form\neither homo-oligomeric channels or associate with another TMD to form\nhetero-oligomers.\n\nThe 3D structure of the E. coli BtuCD proteins has been solved [20]. It\nconsists of two copies of the transmembrane domain BtuC and two copies of the\nATPase BtuD. Each BtuC subunit is composed of 10\nalpha-helices, rather than the six of MsbA, and these are packed together in a\nmore intricated manner than MsbA. Helices two-five and seven-ten are related\nby a pseudo-two-fold rotation axis, while helices one and six are nearly\nperpendicular to the plane of the membrane.

ABC transporters are minimally constituted of two\nconserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less\nconserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These regions can be found on the same\nprotein (mostly in eukaryotes and bacterial exporters) or on two different\nones (mostly bacterial importers) [[cite:PUB00014769]]. The function of the integral\ninner-membrane protein is to translocate the substrate across the membrane.\nStudies of P-glycoprotein function indicate that residues lining the proposed\nchamber opening (residues of TM2, TM5 and TM6) play an important role in\nsubstrate recognition [[cite:PUB00018398]].\n\nIn exporters and eukaryotes, ABC transporters consist of a single polypeptide\ncomposed of an N-terminal domain of approximately 320 residues, apparently\ncontaining six transmembrane segments, fused to a highly conserved ABC-ATPase\ndomain of approximately 260 residues [[cite:PUB00004998]][[cite:PUB00003841]][[cite:PUB00018399]]. In some cases an N-terminal\npeptidase domain of 130-150 residues appended to the TMD is also found, which\nmay contain additional transmembrane segments as in the HlyB subfamily [[cite:PUB00018400]][[cite:PUB00018401]].\n\nThe 3D structure of the E. coli lipid A flippase MsbA homodimer reveals that\nassociation of the two transmembrane domains forms one chamber that adopt a\ncone-shape which extends along a pseudo two-fold axis perpendicular to the\ncell membrane [10]. The chamber has an opening on either side\nof the membrane to provide free access for the lipid substrate from the\ncytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer, while excluding molecules from the\nouter leaflet. The chamber openings are defined by intramolecular interactions\nbetween TM2 of one monomer and TM5 of the other. The residues lining the\nchamber are contributed by all 12 transmembrane alpha-helices [10,11].\n\nIn importers (found only in prokaryotes or archaea) most ABC transporters\nconsist of four domains usually encoded by independent polypeptides, two ABC\nmodules and two TMDs which are thought to contain six transmembrane regions\n[12,13]. The approximately 30 kD TMD displays a distinctive signature, the EAA\nmotif, a 20 amino acid conserved sequence located about 100 residues from the\nC-terminus. The motif is hydrophilic and has been found to reside in a\ncytoplasmic loop located between the penultimate and the antepenultimate\ntransmembrane segment in all proteins with a known topology [14,15,16]. It\nappears to play an important role in ensuring the correct assembly of the\nprokaryotic ABC transport complex [17] and constituting an interaction site\nwith the so-called helical domain of the ABC module [18,19]. The TMDs form\neither homo-oligomeric channels or associate with another TMD to form\nhetero-oligomers.\n\nThe 3D structure of the E. coli BtuCD proteins has been solved [20]. It\nconsists of two copies of the transmembrane domain BtuC and two copies of the\nATPase BtuD. Each BtuC subunit is composed of 10\nalpha-helices, rather than the six of MsbA, and these are packed together in a\nmore intricated manner than MsbA. Helices two-five and seven-ten are related\nby a pseudo-two-fold rotation axis, while helices one and six are nearly\nperpendicular to the plane of the membrane. The prominent cytoplasmic loop\nbetween helices six and seven folds into two short helices, L1 and L2, which\nmake extensive contacts with BtuC.

The knottin scaffold is a very special disulphide through disulphide knot, in which the III-VI disulphide bond crosses the macrocycle formed by two other disulphide bonds (I-IV and II-V) and the interconnecting backbone segments, where I-VI indicates the six cysteine residues starting from the N terminus; for further information see the KNOTTIN database (https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/KNOTTIN/).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conotoxins represent a unique arsenal of neuropharmacologically active peptides that have been evolutionarily tailored to afford unprecedented and exquisite selectivity for a wide variety of ion-channel subtypes. The toxins derived from cone snails are currently being investigated for the treatment of chronic pain, epilepsy, cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric and movement disorders, spasticity, cancer, stroke as well as an anesthetic agent. Several potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory peptides from conotoxin families have been identified and patented [[cite:PUB00016662], [cite:PUB00016620]], e.g. Conus magus (Magus cone) (Magician's cone snail) omega-conotoxin MVIIa (Ziconotide), which is used for the treatment of chronic pain, Conus catus (Cat cone) omega-conotoxin CVID, which is tested for treating severe morphine-resistant pain stress, and Conus geographus (Geography cone) (Nubecula geographus) omega-conotoxin GVIA, which may exert antagonistic effects against beta-endorphin induced anti-nociception.&lt;/p&gt;"],"name":["Conotoxin I2"],"source_database":["INTERPRO"]}},{"id":"IPR044483","source":"interpro7_family","fields":{"description":["&lt;p&gt;This entry represents aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1 (AKR1D1).

This cis-configuration is crucial for bile acid biosynthesis and plays important roles in steroid metabolism [[cite:PUB00096111]]. It is capable of reducing a broad range of delta-4-3-ketosteroids from C18 (such as, 17beta-hydroxyestr-4-en-3-one) to C27 (such as, 7alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one) [[cite:PUB00050777]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) protein superfamily members reduce carbonyl substrates such as: sugar aldehydes, keto-steroids, keto-prostaglandins, retinals, quinones, and lipid peroxidation by-products [[cite:PUB00002548], [cite:PUB00096110]].

The hydrophobic nature of the pocket favours aromatic and apolar substrates over highly polar ones [[cite:PUB00005156]]. They catalyse an ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism in which NAD(P)H cofactor binds first and leaves last [[cite:PUB00096110]].

In rodents, it seems essential for normal embryonic development; mice lacking Cx26 die in utero at about embryonic day 11. Absence of Cx26 impairs transplacental movement of glucose, thus impairing embryonic development. In humans, spontaneously-occurring mutations in the gene encoding Cx26 have been found to be associated with a quite different disorder, non-syndromic neurosensory autosomal recessive deafness, the most common form of inherited hearing loss. Consistent with a role in auditory transduction, Cx26 is the predominant connexin isoform expressed in the organ of Corti of the cochlea. Here, it may be involved in maintaining the ionic balance of the endolymph, by providing a pathway for ions necessary to maintain this potassium-rich fluid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two sets of nomenclature have been used to identify the connexins. The first, and most commonly used, classifies the connexin molecules according to molecular weight, such as connexin43 (abbreviated to Cx43), indicating a connexin of molecular weight close to 43kDa. However, studies have revealed cases where clear functional homologues exist across species that have quite different molecular masses; therefore, an alternative nomenclature was proposed based on evolutionary considerations, which divides the family into two major subclasses, alpha and beta, each with a number of members [[cite:PUB00005237]]. Due to their ubiquity and overlapping tissue distributions, it has proved difficult to elucidate the functions of individual connexin isoforms. To circumvent this problem, particular connexin-encoding genes have been subjected to targeted-disruption in mice, and the phenotype of the resulting animals investigated. Around half the connexin isoforms have been investigated in this manner [[cite:PUB00005511]]. Further insight into the functional roles of connexins has come from the discovery that a number of human diseases are caused by mutations in connexin genes. For instance, mutations in Cx32 give rise to a form of inherited peripheral neuropathy called X-linked dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [[cite:PUB00005549]]. Similarly, mutations in Cx26 are responsible for both autosomal recessive and dominant forms of nonsyndromic deafness, a disorder characterised by hearing loss, with no apparent effects on other organ systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The connexins are a family of integral membrane proteins that oligomerise to form intercellular channels that are clustered at gap junctions. These channels are specialised sites of cell-cell contact that allow the passage of ions, intracellular metabolites and messenger molecules (with molecular weight less than 1-2kDa) from the cytoplasm of one cell to its opposing neighbours. They are found in almost all vertebrate cell types, and somewhat similar proteins have been cloned from plant species. Invertebrates utilise a different family of molecules, innexins, that share a similar predicted secondary structure to the vertebrate connexins, but have no sequence identity to them [[cite:PUB00005532]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate gap junction channels are thought to participate in diverse biological functions. For instance, in the heart they permit the rapid cell-cell transfer of action potentials, ensuring coordinated contraction of the cardiomyocytes. They are also responsible for neurotransmission at specialised 'electrical' synapses. In non-excitable tissues, such as the liver, they may allow metabolic cooperation between cells. In the brain, glial cells are extensively-coupled by gap junctions; this allows waves of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;to propagate through nervous tissue, and may contribute to their ability to spatially-buffer local changes in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;concentration [[cite:PUB00005545]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The connexin protein family is encoded by at least 13 genes in rodents, with many homologues cloned from other species. They show overlapping tissue expression patterns, most tissues expressing more than one connexin type. Their conductances, permeability to different molecules, phosphorylation and voltage-dependence of their gating, have been found to vary. Possible communication diversity is increased further by the fact that gap junctions may be formed by the association of different connexin isoforms from apposing cells. However, in vitro studies have shown that not all possible combinations of connexins produce active channels [[cite:PUB00000087], [cite:PUB00000926]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hydropathy analysis predicts that all cloned connexins share a common transmembrane (TM) topology. Each connexin is thought to contain 4 TM domains, with two extracellular and three cytoplasmic regions. This model has been validated for several of the family members by&lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;biochemical analysis. Both N-and C-termini are thought to face the cytoplasm, and the third TM domain has an amphipathic character, suggesting that it contributes to the lining of the formed-channel. Amino acid sequence identity between the isoforms is ~50-80%, with the TM domains being well conserved. Both extracellular loops contain characteristically conserved cysteine residues, which likely form intramolecular disulphide bonds. By contrast, the single putative intracellular loop (between TM domains 2 and 3) and the cytoplasmic C terminus are highly variable among the family members. Six connexins are thought to associate to form a hemi-channel, or connexon. Two connexins then interact (likely via the extracellular loops of their connexins) to form the complete gap junction channel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;\n       NH2-***        ***        *************-COOH\n             **     **   **      **\n             **    **     **    **   Cytoplasmic\n          ---**----**-----**----**----------------\n             **    **     **    **   Membrane\n             **    **     **    **\n          ---**----**-----**----**----------------\n             **    **     **    **   Extracellular\n              **  **       **  **\n                **           **\n&lt;/pre&gt;"],"name":["Connexin 26"],"source_database":["INTERPRO"]}},{"id":"IPR005775","source":"interpro7_family","fields":{"description":["&lt;p&gt;Transmembrane ATPases are membrane-bound enzyme complexes/ion transporters that use ATP hydrolysis to drive the transport of protons across a membrane.
